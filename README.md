(Question 1)
Implement function CountNumbers that accepts a sorted array of unique integers and, efficiently with respect to time used, counts the number of array elements that are less than the parameter lessThan.For example, SortedSearch.CountNumbers(new int[] { 1, 3, 5, 7 }, 4) should return 2 because there are two array elements less than 4.


(Question 2)
A TrainComposition is built by attaching and detaching wagons from the left and the right sides, efficiently with respect to time used.
For example, if we start by attaching wagon 7 from the left followed by attaching wagon 13, again from the left, we get a composition of two wagons (13 and 7 from left to right). Now the first wagon that can be detached from the right is 7 and the first that can be detached from the left is 13.Implement a TrainComposition that models this problem.
